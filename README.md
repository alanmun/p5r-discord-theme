# p5r-discord-theme
Theme for Better Discord, inspired by Persona 5 Royal

## Installing
`p5r.theme.css` is the only file you need. All other files in the repository are loaded via the internet. Place this in your themes folder, mine for example is here: `C:\Users\MY_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes`

You need Better Discord to use this theme! If you don't have that, get it here: https://betterdiscord.app/

**Important:** 
This theme only works with the basic dark theme provided for free in Discord. If you are using light mode, switch to dark mode. If you are a Nitro subscriber and you are using the color themes provided by Discord (as of writing they are a Beta feature) you should also switch off of them and use the basic dark theme.

Additionally, I recommend turning "Sync profile themes" option on, its in User Settings -> Accessibility (underneath the App Settings sub-section):

## Features
- CI/CD style updates gives users the latest changes without requiring them to reinstall the theme. There will never be an update you have to manually perform in BetterDiscord for this theme unless BetterDiscord changes something themselves.
- Ransom style fonts mimic the flashy font used in Persona 5
  - More relaxed fonts used elsewhere, for example any new + constantly changing text content to ease on eye strain (its not fun to read everything as a ransom note)
- Assets ripped directly from Persona 5 such as the perfectly looping twinkling star gif (Ex: `p5star.gif`)
  - Other assets recreated in Figma to replicate various UI elements from the game (Ex: `spikyCircleMenuButton.svg`)
- Animations when hovering over buttons mimic UI/UX of P5R

## Want to help contribute?
I have a full time job now as a software engineer and on the side I am doing solo indie game dev, so I just don't have the time to maintain this project anymore. If you would like to contribute by opening a PR with suggested changes, that would be really appreciated. What I ask is:
1. Provide a before/after screenshot comparison so reviewers can quickly tell how its different now
2. Make sure that it works on the basic dark theme provided for free on Discord. If it also works in other themes, that's great, but the goal is to just get the theme to look nice when set to dark mode at the very least.

And that's it. You are also welcome to fork this project if you want to maintain your own version.

## Any issues?
If you have any problems with the theme, or feedback, or just opinions on how the theme should look, feel free to create an issue in the Issues tab and let me know!
